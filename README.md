# >GLOBAL POPULATION ANALYSIS – POWER BI DASHBOARD
 
>Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that visualizes and analyzes global population data across various countries. It provides insights into gender distribution, age demographics, population density, and overall global trends.
The dashboard enables users, researchers, and analysts to understand how population structures differ worldwide and how they impact socio-economic factors.

# >Key Insights from the Dashboard

1. Male and Female Population (in millions):
   - Compare male and female populations across top countries like India, China, USA, Indonesia, and Pakistan.

2. Sex Ratio (males per 100 females):
   - Examine gender balance across different regions.

3. Age Distribution:

   - Population aged 0–14 years – highlights countries with younger populations.

   - Population aged 60 years and above – identifies nations with aging populations.

4. Population Density:
   - Visualizes the most densely populated countries such as Monaco, Singapore, and Bahrain.

5. Total Population by Country:
   - Displays global distribution and ranking based on population size.
